# BigDataWork
This folder consists of lakehead university Big data course assignments and a final project Fall-2019.

This complete course work has been done in RStudio platform.

Assignment 1: It is specifically based on KNN algorithm performing different given tasks like implementing 1NN, KNN, Weighted KNN without using any libraries which was a pretty good challenge for this first assignment.

Assignment 2: This assignment involves implemention of 
1) Clustering with silhoutte calculations, 
2) Naive Bayes algorithm, 
3) feature selection and 5 fold cross validation 
4) function to calculate accuracy and performance using stratified cross validation
without using any kind of libraries for given algorithms. 
This was a real brainstormer assignment for the coursework.

Each folder consists of a pdf file which gives a self explanation of an assignment.

To run the project,
Please follow the guidelines in report pdf file under appendix section.
